    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Yi Huan Yang, I use she/her pronouns and I am an undergraduate studying User Experience Interaction
        Design who is currently based in Philadelphia. While I do value my space and peace, I love spending quality time
        with my friends and meeting new people when I have the emotional and mental capacity. A couple other hobbies I
        really enjoy include hiking, kayaking, cooking, karate, and dance.
    </p>

    <p>
        In terms of community involvement, I am very in touch with my cultural and racial identity as I am currently on
        the executive board for two student organizations as the Conference Director for Asian Students Association and
        Cultural Director for the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers.

    <h2>Photography:</h2>
    <p>
        I have been doing photography for about 6 years now, and while I enjoy various styles of photography, I have
        been leaning more towards portrait photography. I shoot with a Canon EOS 80D with usually a 55 mm lens or 75 mm
        lens.
