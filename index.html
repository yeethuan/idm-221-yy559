    <h1>Hi I'm Yi Huan</h1>

    <p>
        I use she/her pronouns and I am an undergraduate studying User Experience Interaction
        Design who is currently based in Philadelphia. As an ISFP I really enjoy both meeting new people and spending time with friends, but also having alone time for myself. A couple ofhobbies I
        enjoy include hiking, kayaking, cooking, martial arts, and dance.
    </p>

    <p>
        In terms of community involvement, I am very in touch with my ethnic and racial identity as I am currently on
        the executive board for two student organizations as the Conference Director for Asian Students Association and
        Cultural Director for the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers.
    </p>

    <h2>Photography:</h2>
    <p>
        I have been doing photography for about 6 years now, and while I enjoy various styles of photography, I have
        been leaning more towards portrait photography. I shoot with a Canon EOS 80D using a 35-55 mm lens or 50-75 mm
        lens.
