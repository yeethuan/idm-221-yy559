    <h2>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</h2>

    <h3>Asian Americans United</h3>
    <p>
        I have been involved with AAU since working as a high school intern to learn about social justice issues and
        current events in the community. This summer, I worked as a program co-lead to curate a 6-week intensive high
        school summer program about social justice, community values, and racial identity. I facilitated sensitive
        conversations pertaining to Asian American history, Black and Asian solidarity, immigration, sexual orientation,
        gender identity, gentrification, and more. I oversaw and trained youths to learn how to interview individuals in
        the context of sensitive topics like those mentioned above for research purposes.

    <h3>Bloomberg Arts Internship at the Fabric Workshop and Museum</h3>
    <p>
        During my time as a Development Intern, I completed competitive analysis of 10+ museum membership programs to
        present and brainstorm ideas on improving in-house membership programs. I designed the official invitation for
        a formal gathering in collaboration with Marlborough Gallery. I arranged profile booklets for artists Henry Taylor
        and Ahmed Alsoudani. I also presented a final project on my fabric design print.

    <h3>Asian American Philadelphia Advocacy Conference</h3>
    <p>
        During my freshman year of college, I was on the leadership team for the Asian American Philadelphia Advocacy
        Conference (AAPAC) as a member of the Marketing Committee where I developed a strategic marketing plan and
        designed graphics to promote the event, resulting in an attendance of 80+ attendees; this was double the amount
        from previous years.
